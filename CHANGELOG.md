# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The version number follows this ecosystem's "odometer" scheme: PATCH +1 on every real build, rolling into MINOR past 9 (`0.0.9` -> `0.1.0`); MAJOR is bumped manually only.

## [Unreleased]

- The banner follows the animated style of the ecosystem banners, with the name, the kind and the technologies of the project.
## [0.0.1] - The project container, its metadata and the machine telemetry types

- **The `.eh3dproj` container:** a ZIP archive with `project.json`, `integrity.json` and the folders `layers/`, `toolpaths/` and `vision/`. The writer is deterministic and writes through a temporary file.
- **Integrity:** the SHA-256 and the size of every entry are recorded; a package with a changed, missing or unlisted entry does not open.
- **Limits:** entry names that could leave the package folder are refused, and so are oversized or too many entries.
- **Metadata:** name, identity, units, zero of the workpiece, layers, tools, toolpaths and fiducials, validated, with a semantic format version: a newer major version is refused and an older one needs a registered migration (there is none yet).
- **Telemetry types:** axes, spindle, machine states and GRBL alarm codes with their severity.
- **Theme:** the colours of the suite with a contrast check.
- 29 tests, `cargo clippy -D warnings` and `cargo fmt --check` in CI on Linux and Windows, and a repository check of the manifest, the versions, the changelog and the eight README files.
